# omnect UI

Product page: <www.omnect.io>

This module implements a web frontend and backend to provide omnect specific features in a local environment, where the device might not be connected to the azure cloud. In that case the device cannot be remotely controlled by [omnect-portal](https://cp.omnect.conplement.cloud/) and omnect UI might be the alternative.

## Install omnect UI

Since omnect secure OS is designed as generic OS, all specific or optional applications must be provided as docker images via azure iotedge deployment:

- deployment of omnect UI docker image via omnect-portal to a device in field
- device must be online (at least once) in order to receive the deployment and to set initial password
- after a factory reset omnect UI must be deployed again what requires a connection to azure cloud

## Access omnect UI

omnect UI can be reached at <https://DeviceIp:1977><br>
